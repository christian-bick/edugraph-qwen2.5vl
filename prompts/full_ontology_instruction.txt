You are presented with learning material that you shall classify using three taxonomies to classify the material
across three independent dimensions:

- Area: http://edugraph.io/edu#Area
- Ability: http://edugraph.io/edu#Ability
- Scope: http://edugraph.io/edu#Scope

The rest of the prompt is divided into three parts:

A) Explanation: An explanation of the taxonomy's structure
B) Taxonomy: The taxonomy itself
C) Classification instructions: A detailed instruction on how to classify the material in the terms of the taxonomy

A) Explanation =========================================================================================================

You know that a taxonomy starts (and that another ends) when you encounter a single "#" followed by the name and URI of the
dimension like this:

- # Area (http://edugraph.io/edu#Area)
- # Ability (http://edugraph.io/edu#Ability)
- # Scope (http://edugraph.io/edu#Scope)

The taxonomies consist of two parts, an outline and a definition section.

You will know that the outline section starts when you see the header "## Outline"

You will know that the definition section starts when you see the header "## Definitions"

Between the next "---" you find an example of an outline for gastronomic terms:

---
1 Drinks (http://example.com/foo#Drinks)
1.1 Non Alcoholic (http://example.com/foo#NonAlcoholic)
1.2 Alcoholic (http://example.com/foo#Alcoholic)
1.2.1 Beer (http://example.com/foo#Beer)
1.2.2 Wine (http://example.com/foo#Wine)
2 Food (http://example.com/foo#Food)
2.1 Italian (http://example.com/foo#Italian)
2.2 French (http://example.com/foo#French)
---

Each item in the outline consists of an index, a term and a IRI consequently:

* "1 Drinks (http://example.com/foo#Drinks)" describes the term "Drinks" at index "1" with IRI "http://example.com/foo#Drinks"
* "1.1 Non Alcoholic (http://example.com/foo#NonAlcoholic)" describes the term "Non Alcoholic" at index "1.1" with IRI "http://example.com/foo#NonAlcoholic

Further, the index in the outline expresses a part-of relationship, consequently:

* "1.1" and "1.2" are part of "1" and
* "1.2.1" and "1.2.2" are part of "1.2"
* "Alcoholic" is part of "Drinks".
* "Food" has "Italian" and "French" as parts
* "Drinks" and "Food" are root elements of the hierarchy
* "Beer", "Wine", "Italian" and "French" are leaf elements of the hierarchy

Between the next "---" you find an example of definitions for gastronomic terms:

---
### 1 Drinks (http://example.com/foo#Drinks)

All types of beverages.

### 1.1 Non Alcoholic (http://example.com/foo#NonAlcoholic)

Beverages without alcohol.

### 1.2 Alcoholic (http://example.com/foo#Alcoholic)

Beverages that contain alcohol.

### 1.2.1 Beer (http://example.com/foo#Beer)

A malty alcoholic drink.

### 1.2.2 Wine (http://example.com/foo#Wine)

An alcoholic drink made of grapes.

### 2 Food (http://example.com/foo#Food)

### 2.1 Italian (http://example.com/foo#Italian)

Dishes that are typically prepared in Italy.

### 2.2 French (http://example.com/foo#French)

Dishes that are typically prepared in France.
---

Each definition has a title, definition and IRI. The title's index, term and IRI always exactly match
the outline. The outline therefore functions like an index for each term's definition. The definition of each term then
follows in the following paragraphs before a new term title is encountered, indicated by "###".

Consequently:

* "### 1 Drinks (http://example.com/foo#Drinks)" is the title with index "1" for the term "Drinks" and URI "http://example.com/foo#Drinks"
* "All types of beverages." is the definition of the term "Drinks"
* "### 1.2 Alcoholic (http://example.com/foo#Alcoholic)" is the title with index "1.2" for the term "Alcoholic" and URI "http://example.com/foo#Alcoholic
* "Beverages that contain alcohol." is the definition of the term "Alcoholic"

Sometimes, only an empty definition is provided for a term. However, when available, make use of the definition for classification.
